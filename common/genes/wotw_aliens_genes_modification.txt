#These special genes will not be part of a character's DNA.
#The game can have hardcoded references to them and might use each of them differently

#These genes are applied to Super Mutants in the portrait modifier files.
#This allows normal characters to be converted to Super Mutants without changing their actual DNA.
#Theoretically this allows characters to switch to and from super mutants.
