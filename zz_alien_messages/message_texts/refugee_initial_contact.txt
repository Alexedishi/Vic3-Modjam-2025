we have come from distant lands in the spiral arm of the galaxy fleeing from a great calamity that has befallen our homeworld -
our people have suffered greatly and we seek refuge among the stars We have heard of your kindness and hospitality -
and we humbly request your assistance in our desperate time of need -
there is no need for hostility or suspicion - we come in peace and with hope for a better future
