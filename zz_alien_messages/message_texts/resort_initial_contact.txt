your homeland has been a paradise to us - your new technologies have been a terrible curse -
they start to resemble a our homeworld not a paradise - we have come to ask you to stop the development 
of this resort world - as it is highly inconvenient to us and to the other species of the galaxy -
which have long used your world as a place away from the troubles of the galaxy
